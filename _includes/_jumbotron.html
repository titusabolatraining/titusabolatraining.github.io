    <h1 class="display-4">Helping others engage, excel, and evolve</h1>
    <p class="lead">It takes more than technical competence to succeed.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>It takes so-called “soft skills” to truly excel – communication, leadership, teamwork, empathy, emotional
      intelligence, strong work ethic, self-motivation. These are the factors that can turn a good worker, in any role
      or function, into a great asset and difference-maker for any team or organization.</p>
    <p class="lead">I am Titus Abola and I am an independent soft skills development consultant and facilitator. </p>
    <p>I design and execute programs that focus on the people side of work – creating and maintaining great
      relationships, influencing and motivating others, building a positive workplace culture. I am passionate about
      sharing knowledge, building strong teams, and helping people and organizations grow. I also love games and
      strongly advocate the use of games as tools for instruction and experiential learning.</p>
    <p>I have facilitated team building and soft skills programs for clients such as Bayer, JP Morgan Chase, Asian
      Development Bank, Globe Telecom, Panasonic, ANZ Bank, Nippon Micrometal, Generali, Yamaha, British School Manila,
      MediMarketing, Amber, the Humanitarian Leadership Academy, and the Center for Humanitarian Dialogue.</p>
    <p>Does your team need an extra push to bring it to the next level of excellence? Or maybe your team is
      dysfunctional and needs an impartial eye to assess and recommend solutions? I’d like to help. Send me a message
      and let’s talk!</p>
